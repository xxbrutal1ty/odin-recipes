                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <h4>Tomato sauce</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat oil in large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium</li>
                        <li>Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes</li>
                        <li>Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until paste is slightly darkened in color (it should start to fry in oil), about 1 minute</li>
                        <li>Add tomato puree, salt, and sugar, and bring to a simmer</li>
                        <li>Partially cover pot with a lid (to avoid splattering), reduce heat so sauce is at a very bare simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 40 to 50 minutes</li>
                        <li>Sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool. Transfer to airtight container; cover and let chill</li>
                    <h4>Chicken and Assembly</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Working one at a time, place chicken breast on a cutting board so short side is towards you and holding a chef's knife parallel to the breast, slice along the middle of long side to make a slit</li>
                        <li>Continue to slice until you are about 1/2" from the other side</li>
                        <li>Open breast up like a book and place between 2 sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap</li>
                        <li>Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound until 1/3" thick (not keeping it super thin will keep it from overcooking)</li>
                        <li>Combine garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil in large baking dish</li>
                        <li>Season chicken cutlets all over with salt (about 3/4 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1/2 tsp. Morton kosher salt per cutlet)</li>
                        <li>Add to marinade and turn to coat</li>
                        <li>Let sit at least 20 min up to 1 hour</li>
                        <li>Make a dredging stating: Whisk eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt, and 2 Tbsp. of water in a large shallow bowl</li>
                        <li>Place panko in another large shallow bowl and flour in a third</li>
                        <li>Whisk remaining 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1/2 tsp. Morton kosher salt into a flour</li>
                        <li>Working with one cutlet at a time and letting any excess materials drip back into baking dish, dredge cutlets in flour, knocking off excess, then dip into egg wash, letting excess drip back into bowl</li>
                        <li>Dredge in panko, pressing firmly to adhere, ensuring no bare spots remain</li>
                        <li>Gently shake off excess and place cutlets on a rimmed baking sheet</li>
                        <li>Chill at least 20 minutes and up to 8 hours</li>
                        <li>Set a wire rack inside a second large rimmed baking sheet</li>
                        <li>Grate mozzarella on the large holes of a box grater into a medium bowl; add Parmesan and toss to combine</li>
                        <li>Pour vegetable oil into a large high-sided heavy skillet to come 1" up sides</li>
                        <li>Heat over medium until an instant-read thermometer registers 400*</li>
                        <li>Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan and returning oil to 400* after each batch, very carefully lower cutlets into skillet with tongs and cook until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes per side</li>
                        <li>Transfer cutlets to prepared rack; season with salt</li>
                        <li>Heat broiler</li>
                        <li>Arrange cutlets side by side in 2 large baking dishes or separately in 4 smaller baking dishes</li>
                        <li>Generously spoon some sauce over each cutlet (you want to mostly cover them but allow some corners and edges to remain uncovered)</li>
                        <li>Spoon remaining sauce into baking dishes around the cutlets</li>
                        <li>Cover cutlets with cheese mixture (again, leaving some of those cripsy edges uncovered)</li>
                        <li>Broil until cheese is melted, bubbling, and browned in spots, about 4 minutes</li>
                        <li>Remove the chicken from the broiler</li>
                        <li>Let cool slightly and sprinkle with parsley</li>
                        
                    </ol>
