            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p1>A recipe for banana pancakes that I found on loveandlemons.com</p1>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bananas, of course, The spottier, the better. The riper your bananas are, the sweeter, moistier, and more flaverful your pancakes will be.</li>
                            <li>All-purpose flour - spoon and level the flour to avoid packing too much into your measuring cup.</li>
                            <li>Baking powder, baking sugar, and an egg - They help the pancakes fluff up as they cook.</li>
                            <li>Cane sugar - It brings out the sweetness of the bananas.</li>
                            <li>Almond milk - Or any milk you like.</li>
                            <li>Avocado oil - You'll add some to the pancake batter and use more for the pan. If you don't keep avocado oil on hand, feel free to substitute vegetable oil or melted butter.</li>
                            <li>Cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract - They add warm, spiced depth or flavor that makes these pancakes taste just like banana bread.</li>
                            <li>Sea salt - To make all the flavors pop.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Whisk together the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another</li>
                            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and fold until just combined</li>
                            <li>Careful not to overmix, if you do the pancakes will be dense</li>
                            <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat, and pour 1/3 cup batter for each pancake into the hot skillet</li>
                            <li>Cook for 1 to 2 minutes of the first side, flip the pancake, then cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li>The pancakes are ready when they're puffed, golden brown, and cooked through</li>
                            <li>If the pancakes are browning on the outside before they're done on the inside, turn down the heat</li>
                        </ol>
